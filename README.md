1. Title: Isaac Montano Portfolio Website
2. Project Description: A portfolio website that acts as an interactive resume in a way. Mainly used to update on any projects I may be working on to improve my software development skills.
   This project lets me have a taste for front-end, and eventually back-end, web development. I will continually update my website unless I forget about it :p.
   As of 01/29/24, I am using simple CSS + HTML for my website, but eventually I want to switch over to React + Flask for my website. But I may change that in the future.
   Right now, the challenges I am facing are that I have no frontend experience, so I'm learning all of this through youtube tutorials and a little bit of AI. The more I learn however, the more I try to go away from that.

   The domain is already bought, I just need to upload the website onto my domain. montanoisaac.net
