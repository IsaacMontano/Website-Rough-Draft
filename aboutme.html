            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>I am a recent computer science graduate from Bradley University, where I was the president of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) and 
                a member of Alpha Psi Lambda National Inc. I am a software engineer who is looking to get into Data Science and Cybersecurity. My most recent project is this 
                website so that I could learn a bit about front-end and back-end development. I will be continually updating the style and layout of this website as well as any new projects that I am working on.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion lies in empowering and supporting others, and my leadership experience in SHPE has provided valuable insights into effectively assisting my peers in reaching their goals.
                I am also passionate about learning new skills and technologies. I'm always looking for new ways to improve myself and my skills. The way that I look at life is that I need to be continually growing and learning. 
                I have found that I am unhappy being complacent in my personal and professional life.
                When I'm not engaged in coding interview practice on platforms like AlgoExpert.io or watching coding tutorials on YouTube, you'll likely find me at the gym, playing soccer, or relaxing with my friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently looking for a full-time software engineering position in the Chicago area. If you would like to contact me, please use the contact form on the contact page.

                I have experience with data science through JuPyter Notebooks and I have experience with cybersecurity through my classes at Bradley University.
